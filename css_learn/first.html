      On the other hand, fibrous roots are branched, bushy roots that originate
      from the stem and have thin, moderately branched roots. Though fibrous
      roots bind the plant less firmly, the large number of threadlike roots
      improves the surface area for water absorption and minerals. The fibrous
      root system is present in many plants, including monocotyledons, rice,
      maize, wheat, marigolds, and bananas.On the other hand, fibrous roots are
